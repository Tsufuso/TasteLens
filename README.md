### **Moroccan Food Recognition and Nutritional Analysis**

*Description*

This project leverages deep learning (EfficientNet-B3) to recognize Moroccan dishes from images and provides detailed nutritional information. The results include:

•Dish name

•Nutritional data (calories, proteins, carbs, fats)

•Explanatory text generated by the Gemini API for easy comprehension.


### **How to Run the Project**
1) *Execute the dependencies setup code:*  
 <u>Run the first section of the code to install all required libraries and dependencies.This ensures the environment is ready for execution.</u>
